<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>1. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p>2. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p>3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p>4. The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
