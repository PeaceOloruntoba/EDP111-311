<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>1. Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p>
<p>2. Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</p>
<p>3. But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p>4. I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
