<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>1. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</p>
<p>2. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</p>
<p>3. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.</p>
<p>4. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
