<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>1. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p>2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>
<p>3. And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>
<p>4. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p>
