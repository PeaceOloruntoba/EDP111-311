<p>2.  And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</p>
<p>3. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p>
<p>4. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p>
