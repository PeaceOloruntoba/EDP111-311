<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>1. And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</p>
<p>2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</p>
<p>3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p>
<p>4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</p>
