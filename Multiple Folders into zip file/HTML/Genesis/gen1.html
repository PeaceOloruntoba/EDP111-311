<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>2. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
<p>3. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
<p>4. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
